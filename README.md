# Shifter Forms

## Getting Started

1. Create a form or use an existing one from any form builder, theme, etc
2. Locate the JavaScript selector 
3. Create a new Shifter Form in the WordPress admin for that form
4. Paste the selector into the settings of the newly created Shifter Form
5. Add your Webhook
6. Add a confirmation page

## Locating the JavaScript Selector

This can be done using the ID or a unique class of the form. The recommended method is using Chrome Dev Tools or similar to view the DOM, select and right click the form element and select Copy / Copy selector.

## Confirmation Page

The page users are redirected to after submitting the form. This page is not created by Shifter Forms. You must created this page in your site or it can be an external site.
